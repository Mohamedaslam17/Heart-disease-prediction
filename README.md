Heart disease is a common and serious health issue that affects millions
of people worldwide. It refers to a range of conditions that affect the
heart, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and heart failure.
Heart disease can lead to significant health problems, such as stroke,
arrhythmias, and even death. It is a leading cause of death in many
countries and has a significant impact on the quality of life of those who
suffer from it. The Heart Disease Dataset is a valuable resource for
researchers and healthcare professionals who are interested in
understanding the risk factors associated with heart disease and
developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.
